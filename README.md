# My ditherings in haskell

A web app. 


To run:

Make sure you have an up to date version of cabal.

You will also need to have a MongoDB instance running in localhost. (Feel free to implement this as config)
```
cabal sandbox init
cabal install
cabal run Main
```


cabal install --only-dependencies - you may also need from time to time.
